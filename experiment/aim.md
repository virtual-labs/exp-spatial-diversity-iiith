This experiment provides basic understanding of the spatial diversity of wireless channel via following objectives:
1) To study the working principle of spatial diversity
   
   Single input multiple output (SIMO), and
   
   Multiple input single output (MISO) ommunication systems
  
2) Analyze the different combining techniques and their performance gains.
