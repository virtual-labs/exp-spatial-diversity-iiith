This experiment provides basic understanding of the spatial diversity of wireless channel via following objectives:

  1) To study the working principle of spatial diversity of
      a) Single input multiple output (SIMO), and
      b) Multiple input single output (MISO)
  communication systems.
  2) Analyze the different combining techniques and their performance gains.
