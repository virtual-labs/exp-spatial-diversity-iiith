The aim of this experiment is to provide the basic understanding of the spatial diversity of wireless channel. The objectives are as follows :

1) To study the working principle of spatial diversity
   1) Single input multiple output (SIMO) system, and
   2) Multiple input single output (MISO) system
  
2) Analyze the different combining techniques and their performance gains.
