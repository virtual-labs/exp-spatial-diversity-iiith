      "question": "How is the weight vector designed in Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC)?",
      "answers": {
        "A": "By maximising the SNR",
        "B": "Using maximum likelihood methods",
        "C": "By minimising complexity",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Correct! In MRC, the weights are chosen to maximise the output SNR by matching the phase and scaling with the channel gains.",
        "B": "Incorrect. Maximum likelihood methods are used for detection, not for designing MRC weights.",
        "C": "Incorrect. MRC is not designed to minimise complexity — it is more complex than SC or EGC.",
        "D": "Incorrect. There is a defined method: maximising SNR."

    {
      "question": "What is the principle behind designing weight vectors for transmitter diversity schemes when the channel is known?",
      "answers": {
        "A": "To transmit with more power on the channels with higher SNR",
        "B": "To transmit with more power on the channels with lower SNR to equalise the SNR on each channel",
        "C": "To transmit only on the channel that has the least time delay",
        "D": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Correct! This is the water-filling principle for beamforming: allocate more power to stronger channels to improve overall throughput.",
        "B": "Incorrect. Power is not shifted to weaker channels unless equalisation is the goal, which is not optimal for maximum SNR.",
        "C": "Incorrect. Delay alone is not the main criterion for beamforming weight design.",
        "D": "Incorrect. There is a defined optimal strategy when CSI is known."

      "question": "What is the maximum possible diversity order achievable for a transmit diversity system with M transmit antennas?",
      "answers": {
        "A": "M",
        "B": "M/2",
        "C": "2M",
        "D": "Depends on the channel characteristics"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Correct! The maximum diversity order with transmit diversity is equal to the number of transmit antennas, assuming independent fading.",
        "B": "Incorrect. There is no halving unless there are specific constraints.",
        "C": "Incorrect. The diversity order is not doubled; it is limited to M in transmit-only diversity.",
        "D": "Incorrect. While fading correlation can reduce diversity, the theoretical maximum is still M."

      "question": "What is the diversity order of transmit diversity using MRC?",

        "C": "2",
        "D": "1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Correct! If the system has 4 independent branches (e.g., 4 transmit/receive paths), MRC achieves a diversity order of 4.",
        "B": "Incorrect. This would correspond to 3 independent branches.",
        "C": "Incorrect. This would correspond to 2 branches.",
        "D": "Incorrect. Diversity order 1 is for single-antenna systems."

        "D": "Nr × γ̄"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Correct! Array gain is the improvement in average SNR proportional to the number of antennas, Nr, when signals are coherently combined.",
        "B": "Incorrect. γ̄c refers to combined SNR, not array gain directly.",
        "C": "Incorrect. This ratio describes SNR improvement relative to branch SNR.",
        "D": "Incorrect. This is not the standard expression for array gain."

        "D": "Nr × γ̄"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. Nr alone does not define diversity order unless we specify combining method.",
        "B": "Correct! In some notation, γ̄c is proportional to the slope of the error rate curve in a log-log scale, representing diversity order.",
        "C": "Incorrect. This ratio measures relative gain, not diversity order.",
        "D": "Incorrect. This is not a standard metric for diversity order."

      "question": "For Nr = 3, arrange the following techniques in order of performance.",

        "C": "MRT ≥ EGC > SC",
        "D": "EGC = MRT > SC"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. SC generally performs worse than EGC when SNRs vary.",
        "B": "Incorrect. MRT usually outperforms EGC.",
        "C": "Correct! Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) offers the best performance, followed closely by EGC, and SC is the least effective.",
        "D": "Incorrect. EGC and MRT are not generally equal in performance."

      "question": "Given that the average SNR for each branch in a selection combining system is 10 dB and there are 3 antennas at the receiver, calculate the average combined SNR.",

        "B": "16.02 dB",
        "C": "18.33 dB",
        "D": "13.26 dB"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. This would be the SNR for a single branch, not combined.",
        "B": "Incorrect. This is too high for SC given the average branch SNR.",
        "C": "Incorrect. This is higher than what SC can achieve here.",
        "D": "Correct! Using the SC formula, the expected combined SNR is about 13.26 dB for 3 branches each with 10 dB SNR."
