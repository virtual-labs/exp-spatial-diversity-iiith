      "question": "Which of the following best describes spatial diversity in wireless communications?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Using different time slots to send the same signal",
        "b": "Using different frequency bands to transmit data",
        "c": "Using multiple antennas at different locations to transmit and receive signals",
        "d": "Using encryption techniques to secure the communication"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Please try again.. Spatial diversity is the use of multiple antennas at different locations to transmit and receive signals. This technique is used to improve the reliability of wireless communication systems by reducing the effects of fading and interference.",
        "b": "Please try again.. Spatial diversity is the use of multiple antennas at different locations to transmit and receive signals. This technique is used to improve the reliability of wireless communication systems by reducing the effects of fading and interference.",
        "c": "Correct!",
