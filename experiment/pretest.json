      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Multiple antennas do not inherently increase battery life; they may even increase power use.",
        "b": "Correct! Multiple antennas improve reliability by mitigating fading through spatial diversity and beamforming.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Multiple antennas generally make the receiver more complex.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Multiple antennas usually increase hardware costs, not reduce them."

        "a": "Incorrect. This is time diversity, not spatial diversity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is frequency diversity, not spatial diversity.",
        "c": "Correct! Spatial diversity uses multiple antennas placed apart to reduce fading and improve reliability.",

      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. Beamforming can improve power efficiency but its main role is to focus energy toward a target direction.",
        "B": "Correct! Beamforming shapes the transmitted signal spatially to maximize signal strength at the intended user and reduce interference elsewhere.",
        "C": "Incorrect. Beamforming usually increases transmitter complexity.",
        "D": "Incorrect. Modulation order is unrelated to beamforming."

      "question": "When is equal gain combining (EGC) used?",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "A": "Incorrect. This is more typical for maximal ratio combining (MRC).",
        "B": "Incorrect. EGC does not require CSI at both transmitter and receiver.",
        "C": "Correct! EGC can be applied when only phase information is known at the receiver, without full channel gain knowledge.",
        "D": "Incorrect. There is a defined condition when EGC is applicable."

        "A": "Incorrect. EGC is more efficient in terms of performance compared to selection combining.",
